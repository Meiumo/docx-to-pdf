# Docx to PDF and TXT files

This code making one PDF and TXT file with combined several docx files.
It uses "arial" font and don't supports hieroglyphs.

# Why does this code exist?

This code exists for cases when there is a need to combine one or more .docx files into one .pdf and .txt file.

# How to use

It's quite simple: 
- When you open a program (or script) you'll find a window that asks you to open one or more files. 
- Choose the ones you need (CTRL+LMB if you select severals). 
- Program will create a .pdf and .txt file named 'output', this is your combined file. 
> Keep in mind, that this code working fine with 2007 and later versions of MS Office and wouldn't work with earlier versions


If you have any ideas or hints about the code, I will be glad to take them and try to implement!
